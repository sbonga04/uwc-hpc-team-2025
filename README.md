Welcome to the official repository for the **University of the Western Cape High-Performance Computing Team (2025)**.

This repo contains setup instructions, evidence screenshots, and system configuration files as we prepare for national HPC competitions.

## 🔧 SSH Key Setup

To enable passwordless Git and remote logins, SSH keys were configured and tested.
